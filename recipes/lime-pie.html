    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I moved from Lebanon to Florida spring of 1999, I brought with me my love for cooking and search for new
        recipes. The famous key lime pie was new to me. It was a friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it from
        Costco every time we go for shopping. I tasted the pie at several places, but they were missing that wow flavor.
        I kept playing with the recipe, and the right flavor is found. I live now in North Bay, Ontario, and we only get
        the Key Limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute with fresh lime juice. I hope you all enjoy!!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup toasted slivered almonds</li>
        <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>½ cup key lime juice</li>
        <li>¾ cup cold heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon grated lime zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pulse the almonds in a food processor until finely ground. Combine the almonds with the graham cracker
            crumbs, sugar, and salt. Pour in the melted butter and mix until evenly moistened. Press into a 9-inch pie
            plate.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the crust is baking, beat the egg yolks in a bowl with the condensed milk, cream, and lime zest. Whisk
            in the lime juice a little at a time to thicken the custard. Pour the custard into the pie crust and return
            to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 15 minutes to help the custard begin to set. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack
            before covering loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerating overnight.</li>
    </ol>
